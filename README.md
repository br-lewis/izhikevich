Implementation of [Izhikevich spiking
neurons](https://www.izhikevich.org/publications/spikes.pdf) running on the CPU
and in compute shaders on the GPU using
[`wgpu-rs`](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs).

## Dependencies ##

This requires `gnuplot` be available in the `PATH` when plotting output.

## Building ##

Should Just Workâ„¢ but I found on Windows, compiling `shaderc` from source
used up computer-breaking amounts of memory so I had to use the
[prebuilt lib](https://github.com/google/shaderc#downloads) and the
[`SHADERC_LIB_DIR` envvar option](https://github.com/google/shaderc-rs#setup).
